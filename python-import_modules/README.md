# Python - Import & Modules

This project is about understanding how to import functions, modules, and scripts in Python.

## Learning Objectives

- How to use `import` and `from ... import` in Python
- How to use built-in functions like `dir()`
- How to prevent code from running when imported (using `if __name__ == "__main__"`)
- How to create and use your own modules

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- Code must follow PEP 8 style (checked with `pycodestyle`)
- You are not allowed to use `import *`
- Each file should end with a new line

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
