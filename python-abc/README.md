# Python - Abstract Base Classes

This project is part of the **Higher Level Programming** curriculum at Holberton School.  
It focuses on understanding and implementing **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** using Python's `abc` module.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand what abstract classes are and why they're useful
- Use the `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` decorators from the `abc` module
- Create subclasses that properly implement abstract methods
- Enforce interface contracts in Python using abstract base classes

## 🛠️ Project Structure

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate:
- Defining abstract base classes
- Implementing concrete subclasses
- Polymorphism using abstract interfaces

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the files:

```bash
python3 filename.py
