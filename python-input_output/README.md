# 📂 Python - Input/Output

This directory contains exercises and scripts related to **file handling** and **input/output operations** in Python. The tasks are part of the Holberton School Higher-Level Programming curriculum.

## 📘 Concepts Covered

- Reading and writing to files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `with`)
- Working with file descriptors
- Using JSON for serialization/deserialization (`json` module)
- Managing standard input/output
- Working with `os` and `sys` for file handling and redirection
- Understanding file permissions and metadata using `os.stat`

## 📁 Files

Each Python script in this folder focuses on a specific concept or task related to I/O. Filenames typically follow the pattern `0-read_file.py`, `1-write_file.py`, etc., according to task number.

Example file list (to be updated as needed):

| File               | Description                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `0-read_file.py`   | Reads a text file and prints it to stdout |
| `1-write_file.py`  | Writes a string to a text file         |
| `2-append_write.py`| Appends a string to a text file        |
| `3-to_json_string.py` | Converts a Python object to a JSON string |
| `4-from_json_string.py` | Parses JSON string to a Python object |

> Update the table above as more files are added.

## 🧪 How to Run

To execute any script:
