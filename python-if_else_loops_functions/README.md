# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains Python scripts and exercises focused on:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Function definitions and usage
- Basic logic building and control flow
- Some scripts include input/output formatting using `f-strings`

## Purpose

To practice writing clean, efficient, and readable Python code that includes decision making and repeated execution through loops.

## Files

Each file in this folder demonstrates a specific concept:
- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: Checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.py`: Prints the last digit of a number and evaluates its value.
- `2-print_alphabet.py`: Prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- And more...

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should pass PEP8 style checks
