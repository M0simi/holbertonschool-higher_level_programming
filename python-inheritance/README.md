# Python - Inheritance

This project is part of the **Higher Level Programming** track at **Holberton School**.

## üìö Purpose

This project focuses on understanding and applying the concepts of **inheritance** in Python.  
You'll learn how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, and how to use built-in functions like `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `super`, and `type`.

## ‚úÖ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What is a superclass / base class / parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When instances can have new attributes
- How to inherit from a class
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default base class in Python
- How to override methods and attributes from a base class
- How and when to use `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `super()`, and `type()`

## üìÅ Project Structure

All Python scripts in this project:
- Are executable
- Start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- Include full documentation for modules, classes, and methods

Test cases are stored inside the `tests/` directory and can be run using:
```bash
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
