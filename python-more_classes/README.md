# Python - More Classes and Objects

This project is a continuation of learning about classes and objects in Python.

It focuses on more advanced OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts, such as:
- Class attributes
- Static methods
- Class methods
- `__str__` and `__repr__`
- Comparing objects
- Counting instances

## 📁 Project Structure

Each file contains a Python script that defines a class or builds upon a previous class to add new features or behaviors.

## 🚀 Skills Learned

- Difference between instance and class attributes
- When to use class or static methods
- How to properly override `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__del__`, etc.
- Comparing objects using special methods (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.)
- Writing cleaner and more modular OOP code

## 🧠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of OOP in Python
