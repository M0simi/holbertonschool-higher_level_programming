# SQL - More Queries

This project focuses on more advanced SQL concepts and query techniques using MySQL. The goal is to reinforce understanding of relationships between tables, permissions, subqueries, joins, and grouping data.

## üìö Topics Covered
- Creating users and granting privileges
- Managing databases and tables
- `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY` constraints
- Inserting and selecting data with filters
- Using `JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`
- Performing subqueries
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
