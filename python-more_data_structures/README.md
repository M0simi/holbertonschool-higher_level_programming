# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project is part of the **Holberton School Higher Level Programming** curriculum.

## üìö Purpose

This directory contains tasks focused on working with **more advanced data structures in Python**, mainly:
- **Sets**
- **Dictionaries**
- How to use `map`, `filter`, and `lambda`
- Dictionary comprehension
- Set operations
- Working with iterable objects in more Pythonic ways

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand and use **set** operations
- Use **dictionaries** to store and retrieve data efficiently
- Apply **lambda**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**
- Write more **concise** and **efficient** Python code

## üìÅ Files

Each file corresponds to a specific task:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square_matrix_simple.py` | Computes the square value of all integers of a matrix |
| `1-search_replace.py` | Replaces all occurrences of an element |
| `2-uniq_add.py` | Adds all unique integers in a list |
| `3-common_elements.py` | Finds common elements in two sets |
| `4-only_diff_elements.py` | Finds different elements between two sets |
| `5-number_keys.py` | Returns the number of keys in a dictionary |
| `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py` | Prints a dictionary by ordered keys |
| `7-update_dictionary.py` | Replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary |
| `8-simple_delete.py` | Deletes a key in a dictionary |
| `9-multiply_by_2.py` | Returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2 |
| `10-best_score.py` | Returns a key with the biggest integer value |
| ... | ...more tasks based on project progress |
